# Water-potability
About Dataset
Context: Why I have taken this dataset
Water is the most significant resource of life, crucial for supporting the life of most existing 
creatures and human beings. Living organisms need water with enough quality to continue 
their lives. There are certain limits of pollution that water species can tolerate. Exceeding 
these limits affects the existence of these creatures and threatens their lives.
As per the United Nations (UN) report, about 1.5 million people die each year because of 
contaminated water-driven diseases. In developing countries, it is announced that 80% of 
health problems are caused by contaminated water. Five million deaths and 2.5 billion 
illnesses are reported annually. Such a mortality rate is higher than deaths resulting from 
accidents, crimes, and terrorist attacks.



Content:

The water_potability.csv file contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies.

1. pH value:
PH is an important parameter in evaluating the acid–base balance of water. It is also the 
indicator of acidic or alkaline condition of water status. WHO has recommended maximum 
permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The current investigation ranges were 6.52–6.83 
which are in the range of WHO standards.

2. Hardness:
Hardness is mainly caused by calcium and magnesium salts. These salts are dissolved from 
geologic deposits through which water travels. The length of time water is in contact with 
hardness producing material helps determine how much hardness there is in raw water. 
Hardness was originally defined as the capacity of water to precipitate soap caused by 
Calcium and Magnesium.

3. Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS):
Water can dissolve a wide range of inorganic and some organic minerals or salts such as 
potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, magnesium, sulphates etc. These 
minerals produced un-wanted taste and diluted colour in appearance of water. This is the 
important parameter for the use of water. The water with high TDS value indicates that water 
is highly mineralized. Desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and maximum limit is 1000 mg/l 
which prescribed for drinking purpose.

4. Chloramines:
Chlorine and chloramine are the major disinfectants used in public water systems. 
Chloramines are most formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water. 
Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per litre (mg/L or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered 
safe in drinking water.

5. Sulfate:
Sulphates are naturally occurring substances that are found in minerals, soil, and rocks. 
They are present in ambient air, groundwater, plants, and food. The principal commercial 
use of sulphate is in the chemical industry. Sulfate concentration in seawater is about 2,700 
milligrams per litre (mg/L). It ranges from 3 to 30 mg/L in most freshwater supplies, although 
much higher concentrations (1000 mg/L) are found in some geographic locations.

6. Conductivity:
Pure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather a good insulator. Increase in 
ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally, the number of 
dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity (EC) 
measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to 
WHO standards, EC value should not exceed 400 μS/cm.

7. Organic_carbon:
Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter 
(NOM) as well as synthetic sources. TOC is a measure of the total amount of carbon in 
organic compounds in pure water. According to US EPA < 2 mg/L as TOC in treated / 
drinking water, and < 4 mg/Lit in source water which is use for treatment.

8. Trihalomethanes:
THMs are chemicals which may be found in water treated with chlorine. The concentration of 
THMs in drinking water varies according to the level of organic material in the water, the 
amount of chlorine required to treat the water, and the temperature of the water that is being 
treated. THM levels up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.

9. Turbidity:
The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended 
state. It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the 
quality of waste discharge with respect to colloidal matter. The mean turbidity value obtained 
for Wonda Genet Campus (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO recommended value of 5.00 
NTU.

10. Potability:
Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not 
potable.


Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of 
effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at 
a national, regional, and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in 
water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse 
health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions
Potable water is a threatened resource for the developing world.
So, it is important to check the quality of water before drinking


Aim of the project:
1. To Classify the water quality whether it is potable or not based on the features 
provided.
2. To find if there is any Correlation between different columns and its effect on the 
potability of water.
3. Major causes for the non-potability of water.
